# Induction-2025
Day 1: A Grand Welcome and a Powerful Mantra
# My first day at GNDEC began in the auditorium with a sense of excitement and anticipation. Surrounded by my fellow CSE and IT students, I listened intently to the speakers, including Harpreet Mam, who made us feel like a part of the GNDEC family. Our principal's motivating words and the NSET Director's historical insights reminded us of the institution's 68-year legacy. The day's most profound lesson came from the ADGP Officer: "Don’t be easily impressed; there’s always more to learn." I left with a resolve to seize every opportunity, a lesson I learned the hard way after missing out on chocolates given to those who spoke up.
# Day 2: Stepping onto the Stage and into Leadership
The second day presented an immediate chance to put my resolution into practice. Dr. Arvind Dhingra's call for volunteers led me to shed my reserved nature and join a team on stage. We played a strategy game and introduced ourselves, breaking the ice with our peers. Dr. H.S. Rai, the Controller of Examination, then shared a fascinating perspective on exams as opportunities to shine. His talk was followed by a pivotal moment: he selected ten students to work with him. I was chosen for this group, which later grew to 50 members in the CodeGNE club. This was an extraordinary opportunity to begin learning advanced technologies from the second day of college.
# Day 3: Values, Creativity, and Collaboration
The third day was a mix of intellectual and creative growth. We began with a lecture on Universal Human Values, exploring the concept of true happiness and contentment. Our seniors then introduced us to Canva, a powerful tool for visual design, which was an eye-opener for those of us looking to boost our creative skills. The day concluded with a leadership activity as part of my role in CodeGNE. I hosted a doubt session for my group members, a rewarding experience that solidified my understanding and fostered a strong sense of community within the team.
# Day 4: Mastering GitHub and Finding Life's Mantra
Day four was a blend of technical and motivational learning. Dr. Randhir Sir's session on GitHub was a game-changer, providing us with a foundational skill for version control and collaboration. We created our first repository, marking a significant step in our journey as developers. The day continued with inspiring talks from Dr. Pyare Lal, who shared famous poems, and Mr. Sony Goyal, who introduced a powerful mantra for success: "Give your 100%" and "Do what you love, love what you do." These words of wisdom provided a clear roadmap for our academic and personal lives.
# Day 5: The Vision of the IT Department
Our fifth day focused on understanding the core of our academic home. We gathered outside the IT department and were guided to the hardware lab, where professors detailed the department's inspiring vision: "to train students from villages and transform them into professionals." This commitment to inclusive education was deeply motivating. We also learned about the program-based outcomes, which gave us a clear roadmap for our studies. Later, in a CodeGNE meeting, we focused on the theme of improvisation, learning valuable strategies to enhance our problem-solving and adaptability skills.
# Day 6: Self and Body, and Technical Triumphs
Day six delved deeper into the philosophical and technical. The lecture on Universal Human Values explored the distinct needs of the Self and the Body, highlighting how harmony is achieved when imagination aligns with natural acceptance. In the second lecture, our seniors gave a practical introduction to Canva, where we created our first template. The day's highlight for me was a CodeGNE meeting on improvisation, which was followed by a discussion of my technical learnings and challenges. I shared my progress in mastering GitHub, learning Markdown, and successfully installing and using Pandoc, an experience that taught me the importance of perseverance.
# Day 7: Inspirational Stories and Community Service
The seventh day was a day of profound inspiration. Prof. Harpal Singh Pannu captivated us with stories of his life struggles and shared enlightening Sakhis of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Following this, a Universal Human Values lecture deepened our understanding of relationships, focusing on the nine feelings that form their foundation. The day concluded with presentations on the benefits of joining the National Cadet Corps (NCC) and the National Service Scheme (NSS), highlighting the importance of physical fitness, community service, and personal development.
# Day 8: Soft Skills, Science, and a Successful Workshop
Day eight was all about bridging the gap between academia and the corporate world. Er. Kanwardeep Grewal delivered an insightful talk on the importance of soft skills, emphasizing the "ABC of First Impressions": Appearance, Behavior, and Communication. Her message was brought to life by our seniors' role-play on interviews. Later, Dr. Jaswinder Singh, a recipient of the Shiksha Ratan award, made complex topics like induction and surface tension easy and engaging. The day also featured a successful workshop where I led a team in a presentation on Pandoc, demonstrating how to create an ebook. This experience taught me the value of teamwork and resilience in the face of technical challenges.
# Day 9: Self-Reflection and Goal Setting
The ninth day was dedicated to introspection. We were honored to be addressed by the retired principal, Dr. Surinderbir Singh Sarna Ji, who shared motivational stories of his successful former students. He encouraged us to relax, reflect, and write down our good and bad traits, as well as our goals and expectations from college. This was a powerful exercise in self-awareness. Our second guest, Dr. Pushpinder Singh, then delved into the fascinating topic of memory and learning styles, providing practical insights on how to optimize our learning processes.
# Day 10: Peer Interaction and an Early Finish
Day ten was a calmer, more relaxed day. The morning began with a peer interaction session, a valuable opportunity to connect with fellow students and share our experiences. This helped in building a strong sense of community. We then had a math class, which continued to build our foundational knowledge for the academic challenges ahead. The day finished earlier than usual, providing a welcome break to reflect on the week's activities and recharge for what was to come.
# Day 11: Motivation and Extracurricular Opportunities
The eleventh day was packed with information about the opportunities available to us. We heard from Mr. Gauravdeep Singh, the founder of the "Initiators of Change" club, whose motivational talk resonated deeply. Er. Lakhveer Singh, the Coordinator of the Center of Multifaceted Learning (CML), provided an overview of the various resources available for our personal and professional development. The day concluded with a session by the Causmic Club, which introduced us to the GNDEC Apex program and encouraged us to get involved in their upcoming events.
# Day 12: Math, Tests, and 3D Design
Day twelve was a perfect blend of academic rigor and creative exploration. The morning was dedicated to an intensive math lecture, followed by a test in the afternoon to assess our progress. The highlight of the day was a CodeGNE meeting where students gave a presentation on OpenSCAD, an open-source software for 3D modeling. I was fascinated by how code could be used to create tangible designs and was inspired to explore 3D printing and modeling further.
# Day 13: The Grand Finale - A Hackathon and Celebration
The final day of the induction program was a thrilling conclusion. The day began with a hackathon, "Promising Hackers," where we had one hour to create a 3D college logo using open-source software. I was incredibly proud to secure 2nd position! The competition was followed by a cultural extravaganza in the auditorium, with singing and dancing performances. The induction program concluded with a prize ceremony where all the winners were honored. This day was a perfect blend of competition, creativity, and celebration, marking a memorable end to our two-week journey.
